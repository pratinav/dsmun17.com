<hr>
<img class="chair_img" src="/dsmun17/images/chairpersons/aippm.jpg">

Namaste Delegates!

It is an honour to host you all in the All India Political Parties Meet at the 11th Doon School Model United Nations. I am Shikhar Trivedi, and will serve as your Chairperson this year. I am an SC Form (class 12) student of the ISC Curriculum at The Doon School and poetry, oratory, debating and dramatics have a really special place in my heart.

In committee, diplomacy should be accorded your topmost priority, and your partyâ€™s interests should be at the forefront of your debate. This will be a bilingual committee, with Hindi and English being the two languages for communication. All documentation will be in English.

The agenda provides a lot of scope for points and counter-points and I am expecting my delegates to be well-versed with the background and events of the communal violence in Gujarat in 2002, and have engaged discussions in context to any political involvements in the events. Post committee sessions, I expect the committee to come to a conclusion in the form of a Press Release or a Communique which will be sent out to the public.

All the best for the conference, and see you soon.

Signing off,
Shikhar Trivedi
