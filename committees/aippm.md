Namaste Delegates!

It is an honour to host you all in the All India Political Parties Meet at the 11th Doon School Model United Nations. I am Shikhar Trivedi, and will serve as your Chairperson this year. I am an SC Form (class 12) student of the ISC Curriculum at The Doon School and poetry, oratory, debating and dramatics have a really special place in my heart.

The agenda for this year's AIPPM 2002 is:

"Discussion on the Gujarat Government's intervention, and any other political involvment in communal violence in the State, with emphasis on the year 2002."

In committee, diplomacy should be accorded your topmost priority, and your partyâ€™s interests should be at the forefront of your debate. This will be a bilingual committee, with Hindi and English being the two languages for communication. All documentation will be in English.

The agenda provides a lot of scope for points and counter-points and I am expecting my delegates to be well-versed with the background and events of the communal violence in Gujarat in 2002, and have engaged discussions in context to any political involvements in the events. Post committee sessions, I expect the committee to come to a conclusion in the form of a Press Release or a Communique which will be sent out to the public.

All the best for the conference, and see you soon.

Signing off,

Shikhar Trivedi
