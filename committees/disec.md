“The Disarmament Conference has become the focal point of a great struggle between anarchy and world order… between those who think in terms of inevitable armed conflict and those who seek to build a universal and durable peace.”

―Arthur Henderson

Hello Delegates,

As Chairperson of The Disarmament and International Security Committee, it gives me great pleasure in welcoming all of you to The Doon School Model United Nations Conference, 2017.

Disarmament and International Security or colloquially, DISEC is the first committee of the UN General Assembly. It forms the kernel of the security spectrum of the UN, helping the UN achieve its objective of ‘savings nations from the scourge of war’. More comprehensively, it also urges member nations to collaborate and work coherently to remove all threats on international peace and security. The committee, in general, requires out of the box yet  pragmatic thinking and this is exactly what I expect all delegates to bring to the table, this year. I want committee to uphold the high standards of debate that are expected at the DSMUN, with involvement of as many delegates as possible.

As for myself, I am an ISC student currently in the SC Form (class 12). I have been actively involved in Debates, Cricket, Table Tennis and MUNs in school. In MUNs, I have participated  as a delegate, a Crisis Executive and a Deputy Chairperson.

This year, the agendas that will be discussed in DISEC are:

 International security pertaining to Foreign Military Bases
Arms Trading and Trafficking in Africa
I urge delegates to know their agendas well as my deputy chairpersons—Aayush Chowdhry and Aaditya Gupta—who will be on the prowl! For any further clarifications or assistance, please feel free to reach out to me at chair.disec@doonschool.com.

Lastly, I reiterate, I expect the highest level of debate in hope of reaching a plausible conclusion but, above all, I hope that all of you have a memorable time at Chandbagh and return wiser.
