Greetings Delegates,

My name is Vathsal Kumar Gupta and I am currently pursuing ISC Humanities, hoping to study International Relations in the future. I am an avid reader with a passion for drama and cooking.

The committee, Special Convention on Religion and Terror will be a new and exciting simulation. The committee will be focusing on working on conflicts arising due to religion with religious heads and other exciting portfolios.

The agenda for the committee will be as follows:

- Religious conflicts in Middle East

The delegates are reminded that the discussions in the committee will be of a sensitive nature and thus are required to word their speeches or documents appropriately.

Delegates should be prepared to handle a myriad of crises which will test their intellect, knowledge and impromptu debating skills. The delegates are reminded that the background guide will only serve as a starting point and they are not to solely rely on this document. They must be well-researched using various media to enhance their knowledge.

All the Best! See you at Chandbagh in August!

Best wishes,

Chairperson of Special Convention on Religion and Terror

Vathsal K. Gupta
