Greetings, Delegates! My name is Vedant Mehra and it is my privilege to serve as the Chairperson of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee at DSMUN 2017.

Before moving into the intricacies of committee , I’d like to tell you a bit about myself: I’m from Bombay and am pursuing the IBDP curriculum. My primary interests lie in Economics and History. Outside of academics, I frequently participate in debates, quizzes, MUNs and an array of sports. Most importantly, I am passionate about of global affairs because in a globalised world such as ours, I feel that sustaining that connectivity is crucial for success.

As for the committee; I discourage flashiness and showmanship and would advise delegates to focus on presentation, but not prioritize it over content. Our primary focus shall be the ‘Colonization of Outer Space’, which demands updated information on activities on the interstellar front. The second agenda will be ‘Self-determination of Ukraine’, which will require decisive thinking; something I expect delegates to bring along with their research binders. Thus, delegates are encouraged to be thorough in their research on the topic as well as their portfolio. You will be required to act based on this and this alone, regardless of personal views.

All that is left is for me is to wish you luck with your preparations and remind you that participation in the committee’s proceedings is key to enjoying the experience.

I look forward to working with each one of you this fall!
