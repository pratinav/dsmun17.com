Hello delegates,

Welcome to the Historic Security Council at DSMUN 2017.

My name is Ishan Jhawar and I am honored to be your chairperson this year. I'm in the twelfth standard and pursuing (at least trying to pursue) the International Baccalaureate.  

My journey in MUNing began as a mere chitboy at DSMUN. I have ever since been in love with the heated debate, dynamics, tensions and diplomacy involved in it and am now an avid MUNner. It is my first time as a chairperson and I aim to create an unforgettable experience for you all at DSMUN, this year!

To tell you a little about myself, I love playing table tennis and have even played at various state and national levels. I enjoy playing hockey, serving the community and writing on issues pertaining to economics and International Relations.

Agendas for this year's UNHSC are:

- Iran in 1979
- Yugoslavian Wars

I am extremely excited to be heading the Historical Security council this year, and I expect a high level of research and preparation from the delegates. The agendas selected for this year are undoubtedly going to challenge the delegates on a myriad of levels and hopefully, be exciting and engaging at the same time. I look forward to skillful diplomacy and heated debate in Committee.

Do feel free to reach out to me for any and all concerns you may have.
I can’t wait to meet you all at Chandbagh this year!

Sincerely,

Ishan Jhawar

Chairperson, Historic Security Council
