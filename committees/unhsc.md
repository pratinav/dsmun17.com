Hello Delegates and welcome to the Historic Security Council at DSMUN 2017!

My name is Ishan Jhawar and I am honoured to be your Chairperson this year. I’m in the SC Form (Class 12) and pursuing (at least trying to pursue) the International Baccalaureate.

My journey in MUNing began as a mere chitboy at DSMUN. I have, ever since, been in love with the heated debate, dynamics, tensions and diplomacy involved in it and am now an avid MUNner. I have been for a number of MUNs, most notably HMUN- China. It is my first time as a Chairperson and I aim to create an unforgettable experience for you all at DSMUN, this year!

Beside MUN, I love playing table tennis and have played at various state and national levels in the sport. I also enjoy playing Hockey and serving the community as the School Social Service Coordinator. I am very interested in Economics and International Relations and also love writing on these subjects for various School publications.

I am extremely excited to be heading the Historical Security Council this year, and expect a high level of research and preparation from the delegates. The agendas selected for this year are undoubtedly going to challenge the delegates on a myriad of levels and hopefully, be exciting and engaging at the same time. I look forward to skillful diplomacy and heated debate in Committee.

Do feel free to reach out to me for any and all concerns you may have. I can’t wait to meet you all at Chandbagh this year!

Sincerely,

Ishan Jhawar

Chairperson, Historic Security Council.
