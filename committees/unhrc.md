Dear Delegates,

As the chairperson of the Human Rights Council, it is my honour and privilege to welcome you to the 11th Doon School Model United Nations Conference 2017. My name is Harshit Bansal and I am a SC Form (class 12) student at the Doon School. I have an avid interest in dramatics, Tennis, Cricket and of course, Model United Nations. The first MUN I participated in was DSMUN 2014 as a member of the Secretariat. Having participated in MUNs in various capacities over the years, my love for this activity has only grown.

As defined by the UNO, the Human Rights Council is “an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe”. Its main purpose is to safeguard the fundamental human rights of citizens around the world. Promotion and respect for human rights for all without distinction of race, sex, language, or religion is the essence of this body. All victims of human rights abuses should be able to look to the Human Rights Council as a forum of redressal and, consequently, action.

I expect several things from my delegates through the course of the conference. Mainly, a high quality of debate and discussion with the committee coming up with practical solutions to the agendas. Further, I will be enforcing a strict policy regarding the following of rules of procedures and punctuality in submission of the policy statement of their respective countries before the start of the conference.

Moreover, I expect my delegates to be actively involved in the unmoderated caucuses and play important roles in leading their respective blocs. More than just a formal debate, Model United Nations is about acquiring the subtle nuances of diplomacy. Finally- but most importantly- I expect my delegates to have fun this weekend and learn because there’s always more to DSMUN than you would imagine!

This year, the agendas that will be discussed in HRC are:

- Protection of the rights of sex workers.
- Safeguarding the rights of the Rohingya muslims in Myanmar.

Looking forward to meeting you!

Regards,
Harshit Bansal
