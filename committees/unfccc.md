Dear Delegates,

I am delighted to welcome you to UNFCCC at DSMUN 2017! I am Adityavardhan Agrawal, currently in my final year of IBDP at School. I was a deputy chairperson at DSMUN last year and have been involved with DSMUN in various other capacities. Besides MUN, I have a keen interest in debating, dramatics, politics and science.

Being the base of all activity, climate change is a very vital issue. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty negotiated at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The UNFCCC’s primary objective is to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. The scope of our committee, however, is much broader as it deals with various pressing issues and conflicting political and environmental interests.

To establish a high level of debate, deliberation and diplomatic rigor in the committee, I expect delegates to extensively research on their agendas and formulate their arguments strictly in commensuration with their foreign and domestic policies. I also expect the delegates to show their participation by being actively involved with moderated and unmoderated caucus and voting.

The agendas for this year’s UNFCCC are as follow:

- Trump, Fracking and the Degradation of world order
- Corporate and social responsibility taken by firms and governments

On this note, I wish you good luck and hope to see you prepared and prepped at Chandbagh this fall.

Your’s truly,

Adityavardhan Agrawal
