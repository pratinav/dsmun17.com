### Lok Sabha
<hr>
<img class="chair_img" src="/dsmun17/images/chairpersons/ls.jpg">

Speeches are heard, Votes are taken and Laws are made! Welcome to the Lok Sabha. I am honoured and privileged to be serving as the Speaker of this historic body at DSMUN 2017.

I am currently pursuing ISC Humanities in the SC Form (12th Grade). Outside the classroom, I have founded and manage I-Parliament, a youth parliament. Amongst other things, I have co-authored a research paper which has devised as a ‘Well Being Index’ for India. I also enjoy photography and shooting and am a Spurs fan.

The agendas this year being Section 377 and Demonetisation, both hotly debated topics in Contemporary India, you as an MP are expected to find acceptable solutions to the problems faced by the people while also keeping in mind your party policy and your constituents. You will be expected to come up with a resolution that keeps in mind all sections of society and upholds India’s constitutional values.

I must remind you that as an MP, etiquette and decorum in the House is absolutely essential. As representatives of the people, it is our duty to espouse their causes while balancing political reality. I will request you to be well researched on both agendas. I hope you are as excited abut this committee as I am!
