It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to International Press Corps of DSMUN’17.

As far as introductions go, I am currently pursuing the ISC curriculum in SC Form (class 12), focusing on Humanities. Besides being involved in MUNs, I am also the Editor of three school publications, hence the love for International Press. Moreover, I also like to debate, quiz and play Squash.

As ‘correspondents’ of the international press, your role will be broader than just writing mere commentaries on daily happenings in your allotted commentaries. You will be expected to give an in-depth analysis of the committee in the form of Op-Eds. Please note that you will be required to do some research on the agenda of your committee- to better aid your analysis. Moreover, you may be required to submit transcribed interviews to give not only your opinion but also that of other delegates present in the committee. Correspondents will also be expected to attend press briefings of various committees, in which, delegates will be questioned and made accountable for their actions and decisions.

As Malcolm X says, “The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent.” It is your duty to use this power responsibly and make logically supported judgements. You will be judged on the value of your piece and the writing skill you have employed. I hope to see some great pieces of writing in the future.
