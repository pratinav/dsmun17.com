Hello Delegates!

It’s great to have you as members of the Security Council at DSMUN, 2017.

This year, our committee has been designed with the goal of testing the delegates’ persuasive and collaborative skills- both of which are elemental to diplomacy. On that note, we’ve selected

- the ‘Reformation of the Security Council’
- Russia’s funding of the Taliban in Afghanistan

as the agendas for Committee; both being currently relevant, tricky and controversial topics, we hope they will interest and challenge you as the committee navigates them over the course of three-days.

But, of course, a bit about the best part. I’m an IB Survivor in my final year of School, with a passion for modern history, contemporary studies and political science. To complement these, I’m an avid debater and have participated in national and international debates over the past few years. Additionally, I enjoy investigative journalism and, writing on current affairs, and currently edit The Doon School Weekly. Aside from all this, perhaps my greatest guilty pleasures are good books and milkshakes.

Looking forward meeting and, more importantly, engaging with you at the conference.

À bientôt!
