Greetings Delegates,

As the chairperson of the High Commission for Refugees, it gives me immense pleasure to welcome you all to the Doon School Model United Nations Conference, 2017.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established on December 14, 1950 by the General Assembly. The committee is required to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. It is mandated to safeguard the rights and wellbeing of refugees.

The Executive Board expects delegates to be creative as well as pragmatic in tackling issues of such comprehensive character. As Chair, I want to explicitly clarify that quoting the UN Charter whenever one gets the chance is not half as impressive as a high level of debate and rationale, which I personally look forward to in committee.

This year UNHCR will be focusing on two main agendas, both having respective sub-agendas.

The present refugee crisis with special emphasis on the MENA region.
Problems related to social, economic and cultural re-integration of refugees in the MENA region.
As for myself, I am an S Form student (Class 11) studying the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Having a keen interest in international relations and world affairs, I serve on the Editorial Board of the Schoolâ€™s flagship publication. All delegates are welcome to contact my Deputy Chairpersons Samar Mundi and Darsh Garg, or myself if any special assistance is required.

I hope you enjoy your time at Chandbagh and look forward to meeting the delegates come August.

(Zoraver Mehta)
