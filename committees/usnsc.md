Greetings Delegates!

My name is Archit Barthwal and I will be presiding over the United States National Security Council for DSMUN 2017. I am currently in the SC Form (Class 12) pursuing (and sometimes being pursued by) the IBDP. I do really enjoy MUN-ing and have participated in a couple of MUNs such as HMUN China, MCGSMUN. I was also a Deputy Chairperson at DSMUN 2016.

Apart from MUN-ing, my interests lie in Boxing, Dance and Drama.

As for the committee, besides quality debate and discussion, I would urge all delegates make good use of the post-committee sessions to lobby and build up on the proceedings of the committee for the next. Delegates won’t be graded for doing this, but considering the advantages, they will be in a better position when committee reconvenes.

The USNSC is a very dynamic committee; thus, I expect delegates to be able to think and act in accordance to the dynamism of the committee as well as pay close attention to their own portfolios.

The agenda under the scanner will be the manhunts of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.

Together, let’s make DSMUN great again!

Archit Barthwal (As Prez. Donald J. Trump)
