Dear Delegates,

As the Chairperson of the UN Commission on Status of Women (UNCSW), I would like to extend a warm welcome to all delegates at DSMUN’17. My name is Devang Laddha and I am currently in S Form (Class 11). My key interests are debating, reading, writing and, expectedly, Model UN.

Women’s Rights have been a vital issue that the UN has tried to deal with and was further emphasized as one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Many attempts towards gender equality, however, have fallen short of the intended goal. <b>To tackle this issue, the UNW is to draft a Bill of Rights for women across the world.</b> To make the committee more engaging, this year we have modified the committee to include a more varied group of countries.

Delegates are expected to adapt to the committee and will be judged on their capacity to lobby, their content and their proposed solutions. They are expected to research extensively and provide detailed and concrete solutions that are pragmatic and can be practiced in real life.

Finally, I hope to see you all at DSMUN in August and hope that, along with having a memorable MUN experience, you also enjoy your stay with us!
