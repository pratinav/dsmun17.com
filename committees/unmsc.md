Hello and welcome, Delegates, to the 11th The Doon School Model United Nations, a decade old, prestigious International MUN with high standards of debate and respect for diplomacy.

I am Yuvan Jaidka, your Chairperson for UNMSC. With a keen interest in Politics, Law and International Relations, I started my MUN career in my A Form (class 10) at HMUN China and followed up with several National level MUNs.

UNMSC is a subsidiary body of the UNSC whose role as defined by the United Nations Charter is to plan UN Military operations and assist in regulations of Militaries around the world. While recognizing its dormancy for the past decade, we come together to revive the committee to take on pressing issues set before us in the dynamic geo political world scenario.

The two agendas set forth are:

- Privatization of war with an emphasis on the role of privately funded militaries;
- Challenges in planning of the UN peacekeeping troops and the UNâ€™s call for a standing army, a combination of two interrelated topics which have been heavily debated since the very inception of the United Nations.

I expect Delegates to support their arguments with substantial and reliable resources and facts. The stance of each delegate should be clear with no room for ambiguity.

I wish you the very best of luck and look forward to seeing you all in August.

Sincerely,
Chairperson of UNMSC
